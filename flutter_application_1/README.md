# Personality Analyzer

## About the project

Personality is an essential component of our way of life. It influences how we live,speak, respond, and express ourselves, as well as our mental health. Personality analysis is a natural human capacity that is used on a daily basis with a variety of people and for a variety of purposes. Personality profiling, in particular, has a variety of real- world applications, including exams for screening of mental illness, human resource interview shortlisting, friend recommendations and writer recommendations on the interplay of personalities that people love reading about. This project analyses a person by the answers given by him to our list of questions and finds the personality profile of the person. The deployment of solutions has been explained, and several feature vector combinations and machine learning models have been compared. Using different methods, accuracies of up to 96 percent were achieved.
